# Shubhang Flixx App

Movie info application built with vanilla JavaScript that uses **version 3** of the [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3)

This includes the most populr movies and TV shows with detail pages, a search box for movies and shows with full pagination and a slider for movies that are currently playing in theaters. The slider uses the [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com) library.

## Usage

Just clone or download and then register for a free API key at https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api

Once you get your key, just add it to the `api.apiKey` value in the global state at the top.

## Theme (HTML & CSS)

I also included the theme here for you to download.
